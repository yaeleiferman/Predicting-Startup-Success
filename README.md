# Capstone: Predicting Startup Success

The goal is to predict the success of any given startup using data from previous startups. 
This data will likely include basic information about the companies, and hopefully verbose descriptions and logos as well.

Tasks for the coming week:
- [x] Investigate the data sets here in the repo (and others if needed)
- [] Create a starting database to work with
- [] Conduct a first pass over data to identify data quality issues, feature engineering opportunities, and any other notable observations regarding data preprocessing
- [] Conduct preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis to begin to describe relationships between variables, and start formulating hypotheses for further analysis
- [] Fill in this README with a Project Overview which reflects the structure of the Areas of Interest Submission: explain the Problem Area, including those affected, proposed Data Science solution, the impact of the solution, and a granular description of my dataset (including a Data Dictionary if feasible)
- [] Prepare a 5-slide presentation:
      1. A non-technical overview of the subject area and the problem statement / opportunity you identified
      2. An overview of your proposed vision for tackling the problem using Data Science
      3. An estimate of the potential impact of such a solution
      4. An introduction to the dataset, including data quality concerns and findings from preliminary EDA
      5. Next steps in terms of data processing, feature engineering and baseline modeling
