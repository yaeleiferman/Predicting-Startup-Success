# Capstone: Predicting Startup Success

The goal is to predict the success of any given startup using data on previous startups. 
This data will likely include basic information about the companies, and hopefully verbose descriptions and logos as well.

Tasks for the coming week:
- [] Investigate the data sets here in the repo (and others if needed)
- [] Create a starting database to work with
